# BuildScript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/StarbotDiscord/BuildScript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/StarbotDiscord/BuildScript)

## What is this script?
This is a script for creating a runtime environment for Starbot. Probably not useful if you
just want to tinker with the bot, this is more useful for production where quick deployments
are useful. You can also use prebuilt copies of this environment if you are too lazy to
setup all the Starbot dependencies.

## What platforms are supported?
Officially, 64bit macOS 10.12.X and Ubuntu are supported, but you'll find build scripts for other platforms in here too. Just don't expect them to work perfectly.
