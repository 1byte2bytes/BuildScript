## What is this script?
This is a script for creating a runtime envoironment for Starbot. Probably not useful if you
just want to tinker with the bot, this is more useful for production where quick deployments
are useful. You can also use prebuilt copies of this envoironment if you are too lazy to
setup all the Starbot dependancies.
